## fix error https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues/4354
## using python-version 3.6

## create skeleton from pip package
conda skeleton pypi hcgb --python-version 3.6

It was necessary to modify meta.yaml. Automatic url was not working as the name hcgb was in lowercase but required to be uppercase.

## create conda build
conda-build hcgb/


## 19 October 2023
# I removed pip packages with no conda recipe and it worked!
conda skeleton pypi hcgb
conda-build hcgb/
