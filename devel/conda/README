## May 2022

## fix error https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues/4354
## using python-version 3.6

## create skeleton from pip package
conda skeleton pypi hcgb --python-version 3.6

It was necessary to modify meta.yaml. Automatic url was not working as the name hcgb was in lowercase but required to be uppercase.

## create conda build
conda-build hcgb/


## 19 October 2023
# I removed pip packages with no conda recipe and it worked!
conda skeleton pypi hcgb
conda-build hcgb/


# To upload recipe, follow the guidelines in: https://bioconda.github.io/contributor/setup.html

## create a fork

## create a local clone
git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/bioconda-recipes.git

## Set things proprely:

## To be able to update this folder more easily with changes made to our 
## repository, add the main bioconda-recipes repo as an upstream remote 

cd bioconda-recipes
git remote add upstream git@github.com:bioconda/bioconda-recipes.git

# Make sure our master is up to date with Bioconda
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git push origin master

# Create and checkout a new branch for our work
git checkout -b update_my_recipe


## create an skeleton, modify meta.yaml and execute conda-build
cd recipes
conda skeleton pypi hcgb
conda-build hcgb/


## Push changes
# Choose the edited files to commit:
git add pyaml
# Create a commit (will open editor)
git commit
# Push your commit to GitHub
git push


## After creating a local clone of bioconda-recipes, once you have create the skeleton and build, you can test locally.

conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda bioconda-utils
bioconda-utils build --git-range master

## bioconda-utils will test the recipes build in your local clone vs. master
